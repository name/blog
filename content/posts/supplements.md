below is the list of supplements that i take daily, how much of it, how much it costs, and some information which should roughly explain my reasons for taking it.

i'm not a doctor, so don't take this as medical advice. when it comes to supplements, it's a super personal decision. your age, diet, lifestyle, genes, risk tolerance, and budget all play a role in what might work for you.

| supplement | dosage | what's it good for? |
|------------|--------|---------------------|
| vitamin d3 | 4,000 iu (once daily) | bone health, immune boost, disease fighter |
| vitamin b12 | 5000 mcg (once daily) | nerve function, dna and red blood cell production |
| vitamin k2 mk-4 | 100 mcg (once daily) | bone health, blood clotting |
| glycine | 3-4g (before bed) | better sleep, less daytime fatigue |
